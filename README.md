# Maze Solver Project

This project implements a Maze Solver using Python and the Tkinter library for graphical representation. The maze is generated randomly, and the algorithm solves it using depth-first search (DFS). It displays both the maze creation process and the solution visually.

## Features
- Random maze generation with entrance and exit points.
- Visualization of maze creation and solving process.
- Recursive depth-first search algorithm to find the solution.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Tkinter for the graphical interface
- Recursive algorithms for maze generation and solving

This project is a simple yet powerful example of maze generation and pathfinding, showcasing the use of recursion and graphical representation with Python.
